# pyTranslate

This is a project dedicated to creating an app that can freely translate a multitude of languages into Python. As of now, this is just a personal project to help me learn the intricacies of various languages, as well as gain some experience actually creating an app!

Feel free to use this code however you want, but don't just repackage and steal it please. My goal is for this to become a useful resource available to everyone online, if not just a nifty concept.

My first goal is to translate a script from C to Python and vice versa.
